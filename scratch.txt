"readjust" is a move, to increase submission chances (if succeeds, maintain initiative)

"feel-out" is a move you can do to increase your block/hit probability on your next move
    (can maintain initiative)
    ("feel-out" cannot be meaningfully blocked and just goes through automatically)



these constants:

```
const successRate = {
  "jab": 20,
  "hook": 30,
  "uppercut": 40,
  "body-punch": 25,
  "body-kick": 35,
  "leg-kick": 15,
  "head-kick": 50,
  "grapple": 45,
  "smesh": 80,
  "headbutt-stomach": 75,
  "knee-to-body": 70,
  "kimura": 15,
  "rear-naked-choke": 20,
  "arm-bar": 10,
  "triangle-choke": 10,
  "guillotine": 10
}
```

result in a kind of unbalanced play style where the ideal move is to grapple then spam smesh. Can we balance out the probabilities a bit? (submissions should remain as they are, low chance)
